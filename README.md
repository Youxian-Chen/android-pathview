## android pathview with divided states

##### fork from

	https://github.com/geftimov/android-pathview
	
##### purpose

	this project is awesome but doesn't totally fit my need. so I do some changes.
	now, view can be draw in several states(draw only a few paths of all one time).
	animate forward / backward.
	
##### sample

```java
pathView.setStateDivider(2);//draw 2 paths by one time
```
check details in source code and pathview-divide-sample
